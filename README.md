# What is iRLeagueManager?
As the name says it is an iRacing League Manager.
A complete tool to manage your iRacing league schedules, 
keep track of results and standings and decide on penalties for race incidents with the built in stewarding system.

My goal is to give you all the tools you need to organise your league outside of iRacing and to make league management simple and fun.

# Application
The manager will ship as a standalone desktop application from which you can control all aspects of your league.
On top you will be able to connect to the open REST Api to integrate league data into your existing web page and even allows you to manipulate without using the app.

# Features
- Schedule planner and race Calendar
- Results and Statistics
- Teams and Member Data
- Multiple User Management
- Stewarding System
- Web integration through REST Api

# Current Status
The App is still in full development and will be for some more time.
At the moment i am aiming for a v1.0 release around the end of 2020/beginning of 2021.
